The paper studies the drift instabilities driven by the slab ion temperature gradient (ITG) in Kappa-distributed plasmas. 
The linear dispersion relation is given in an integral representation involving only the standard plasma dispersion function. 
We find that the suprathermal ions can enhance the instability in large wavenumbers but suppress it in small wavenumbers. 
Thus, the suprathermalization of ions could be one of the factors leading to a lower limit of wavenumbers for the ITG instabilities.
This work may be applied to the studies of plasma behaviors in the Earthâ€™s magnetotail.
